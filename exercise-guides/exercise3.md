# Exercise 3: Advanced "FizzBuzz" Challenge

For the final challenge of the workshop, we're going to create a class that allows for custom number ranges with outputs.

Break into teams of three: 
* One tester
* One devops / jenkins admin (manages / monitors Jenkins job execution), 
* One developer 

All individuals must stay in their own realm! The purpose of this challenge is less about the final outcome, and more about creativity and to simulate the difficulty of working in a siloed environment. Find ways to bridge the communication gaps and document
* Workflow results
* Challenges (both technical and interpersonal)
* Final commit / branch
