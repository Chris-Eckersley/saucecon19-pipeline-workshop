# Creating a Continuous Delivery Pipeline with Automated Testing Exercises
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, consult the parent [README](../README.md) for instructions on how to complete the following:

* [Install Git](../README.md#install-git)
* [Install NPM / NodeJS](../README.md#install-npm-and-nodejs)
* [Install and IDE](../README.md#install-an-ide)
* [Install WebDriverIO](../README.md#install-webdriverio)

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/saucecon19-pipeline-workshop/releases) archive and import the project into your local environment and begin experimenting with creating your own automated Selenium tests!

## Setup the Project

#### 1. **Fork the Project Repository**:
First we need to create a one to one copy of the base repository

* Login to your GitHub account
* Navigate to [sauce-training/saucecon19-pipeline-workshop](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/saucecon19-pipeline-workshop)
* Click the **Fork** button:

* After the Fork completes, navigate to your GitHub account profile and open the new forked repo.

#### 2. **Clone the Project Directory**:
* Create a directory on your filesystem to store the project files.
* Copy the forked GitHub repo URL like so:
    
![cloned.png](images/cloned.png)
    
* `git clone` the repository onto your local filesystem. For example:
    
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/saucecon19-pipeline-workshop.git
```
#### 3. **Update Dependencies**:
* Import the root project directory in your editor/IDE of choice:
* [Open a terminal from the project root directory](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac) (or a [command prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) for Windows users) and run the following command:
```
$ npm install
```
    > You may run into NPM errors if you have an older version of WebDriverIO installed, please update to the latest version.
    
#### 4. **Create a Test Pull Request**:
* In the root project directory, add the following method to the **`Calculator`** class in **`src/app.js`**:
    
```
testAlert() {
    this.toString("this is a test alert message for PRs");
}
```
    
* **`git checkout`** a new test branch:
    
```
$ git checkout -b <your-github-username>-test-branch
```
* **`commit`** your changes and **`push`** to the remote
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "<your-github-username> test PR"
$ git push origin <your-github-username>-test-branch
```
    
* Navigate to your GitHub Account profile and open a new Pull Request:
* Click this link:
![pr-link.png](images/pr-link.png)
        
* Ensure that you're opening the PR against the base branch ([saucecon19-pipeline-workshop](https://github.com/saucelabs-training/saucecon19-pipeline-workshop)):
![branch-check.png](images/branch-check.png)
        
* Add a comment if necessary and click **Submit**
* You should see the following messages appear in order on your current PR
    * Automated Message from Jenkins Admin:
    ![Jenkins-message.png](images/Jenkins-message.png)
        
    * Notification that Jenkins Job is Running:
    ![CICD-message.png](images/CICD-message.png)
        
    * Notification that Automated Tests Failed (this is expected) and merge is denied:
