### Install Sauce OnDemand Jenkins Plugin

The [Sauce OnDemand Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Sauce+OnDemand+Plugin) plugin allows you to utilize SauceLabs VMs during you build and deploy cycles. Below are the steps on how to incorporate SauceLabs as a Jenkins build step. If at any point you require further explanation, please vist this [Sauce Labs DOCSDEV](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Installing+and+Configuring+the+Sauce+OnDemand+Plugin+for+Jenkins) page for further details.

#### Install the Plugin
1. On your Jenkins Administration page, click **Manage Jenkins** 
2. Click **Manage Plugins** 
3. Click the **Available** tab. 
4. In the list of plugins, find and select **Sauce OnDemand Plugin**. 
5. Click **Download now and Install after restart**.
    > The plugin file is fairly large, so the download may take several minutes.  
6. In the plugin installation dialog, select **Restart Jenkins** when installation is complete and no jobs are running. 

#### Configure Your SauceLabs Credentials

In order to use the Sauce OnDemand Plugin, you must authenticate your SauceLabs account. The plugin provides an interface for storing your SauceLabs auth credentials as environment variables on the Jenkins Server so that you don't nee dto hardcode them into your tests.

1. Restart Jenkins and go to your **Administration** Page.
2. Click **Credentials**.
3. You can select an existing domain, or select **Add domain**.
4. Select the domain of your choice, and then select **Add Credentials**.
5. Under **Kind**, select **Sauce Labs**.
6. Enter your Sauce Labs **Username** and **Access Key**
    > If you're not sure how to access your SauceLabs credentials go to the [saucelabs.com](https://app.saucelabs.com/dashboard/builds) **Dashboard**, select the arrow next to your account name, and select **User Settings**. Then copy the information to your local clipboard.
7. Click **OK** to save the credentials.

#### Test the SauceLabs OnDemand Jenkins Plugin

1. Open the Jenkins Dashboard
2. Select **Create New Job**
3. Name the job: `jenkins-saucelabs-github-test`and select **OK**
4. In the job configuration, select **Source Code Management**
5. Select the **Git** radial button, and use the following [Git repository URL]() for this test
6. Under **Sauce Labs Options** ensure your credentials exist in the **Credentials** field
7. Optionally, you can choose to enable Sauce Connect for a secure tunnel to the Sauce labs VMs. For more information on this feature, refer to the [Sauce Connect with the Jenkins Plugin](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCSDEV/Configuring+Sauce+Connect+with+the+Jenkins+Plugin) documentation page.
8. Save the configuration and run your job. Navigate to the SauceLabs.com dashboard to see if your test runs correctly.
<br />

### (Optional): Deploy Jenkins using Docker

If you plan on combining this workflow with other service-oriented toolsets, you may want to experiment deploying Jenkins using Docker. For detailed explanation follow the instructions in the Jenkins documentation:[https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker)

#### Install Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) is a containerization platform used to build and control application deployment. 
In this example we use Docker to setup a local jenkins server and then expose a container port of said server

##### MacOSX:

1. Go to [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).
2. Click **Download from Docker Hub**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.dmg` file open the installer package.
4. Double-click the installer package to begin the installation.
5. Continue through the installation prompts.
6. Sign up for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) in order to pull down public docker images.
7. After signing up for Docker Hub, launch the Docker application and set your login credentials

##### Windows:

1. Go to [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
2. Click **Download from Docker Hub**.
3. When the download completes, double-click the `.exe` file open the installer package.
4. Follow the steps in the setup wizard to complete the installation. You should accept all the default settings.
5. Continue through the installation prompts.
6. Sign up for [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) in order to pull down public docker images.
7. After signing up for Docker Hub, launch the Docker application and set your login credentials
<br />


#### Download and Run Jenkins on Docker

##### MacOSX:
1. Open up a terminal window
2. Download the **`jenkinsci/blueocean`** image and run it as a container with the following `docker` cli commands:
```
docker run \
    -u root \
    --rm \  
    -d \ 
    -p 8080:8080 \ 
    -p 50000:50000 \ 
    -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ 
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ 
    jenkinsci/blueocean 
```
3. Explanation: the **`-p`** flag sets **`localhost:containerport`** mappings. In other words, **`8080:8080`** implies that the Jenkins server listens on its internal container port of **`8080`**, and the container itself listens on the localhost port **`8080`**.

#### Windows:
1. Open a command prompt window.
2. Download the **`jenkinsci/blueocean`** image and run it as a container with the following `docker` cli commands:
```
docker run ^
    -u root ^
    --rm ^
    -d ^
    -p 8080:8080 ^
    -p 50000:50000 ^
    -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
    jenkinsci/blueocean
```
3. Explanation: the **`-p`** flag sets **`localhost:containerport`** mappings. In other words, **`8080:8080`** implies that the Jenkins server listens on its internal container port of **`8080`**, and the container itself listens on the localhost port **`8080`**.

Again, for more detailed instrucitons on running Jenkins in Docker refer to the Jenkins documentation page: [https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker)
